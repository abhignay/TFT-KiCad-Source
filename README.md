# TFT-KiCad-Source
TFT KiCad library source repo for all future electronics design projects, including TFTqube and Singularity.


# Usage
Clone TFT-KiCad-Source and import all symbol and footprint libraries, found under /TFT_symbols and /TFT_footprints respectively, to your KiCad installation.

Under `Preferences -> Configure Path` set a new environment variable named `TFT_KICAD_LIB` and set the path to the location where TFT-KiCad-Source is cloned.
